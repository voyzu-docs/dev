### Overview

Voyzu uses a template system, pages are written in HTML, CSS and Javascript.  At run time (i.e. when the browser navigates to the voyzu web application and requests a page) this template is read and transformed into a live, client facing web page.  What makes the voyzu front-end development system unique is that these template files are also designed to render on your local development machine - served by any static web server (see section below on this)
