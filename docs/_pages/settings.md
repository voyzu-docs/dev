## Default sharing mode
Voyzu supports two modes for new domain users:

**Share by default**
In this mode new domain users will automatically have the
```#voyzu shared``` contacts label
 created for them and will have access to all domain shared contacts.  You can later remove a user's access to this folder in the 'users' screen.

**Don't share by default**
In this mode new domain users will not have access to the
<code>#voyzu shared</code> contacts label
unless you specifically allow them access (which can be done in the 'users' screen)

## Access to settings
Viewing and managing settings is an admin only function, only domain admins
or delegated admins can see this page.
