## Troubleshooting
If you are having problems logging in to Voyzu, here are some things you can check

### I receive an error message saying Voyzu has not been installed for my domain
It can take a short while (minutes not hours) for Google to sync install data. If you receive
this warning immediately after installing Voyzu then wait a minute or so and try again.

### I receive an error message 'popup_closed_by_user'
You will get this message if you close the Google 'choose account' screen without selecting an account. If however you are receiving
this error even when you select your account, then you may need to enable third party cookies on your browser.  Third party cookies are a requirement for Google's authentication to work.

### Check that you are logging into the correct product

We offer two contacts management products - Voyzu Contacts Directory which enables you to manage your domain external contacts, and
Voyzu Shared Contacts Manager which is a more fuller featured contact management solution.  You can read more about the products and their
differences <a href="https://voyzu.com/directory-vs-shared.html">here</a>.  You can see which product or products you have installed within the Google Workspace Admin console by navigating to Apps > Google Workspace Marketplace Apps

that the application is available to all users, and all scopes have been granted

### I receive an error message saying Voyzu has not yet been activated
Check that a domain administrator has installed Voyzu and has logged in at least once.

### I receive an error message: "You do not have permission to access Voyzu."
Your Voyzu Google Workspace administrator has not granted you access to Voyzu.  This is done within Voyzu (in the users tab). Contact your domain admin and
request access.

### I receive an error message "Please log in using your primary domain email address"

Admins and regular users must sign in using their primary domain email address, signing in with a secondary domain address is not supported

### I have checked all of these and still can't login
It is possible Voyzu doesn't have the API access it needs.  Check out <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/7281227?hl=en">this support article</a>
