## Welcome
<hr/>
Welcome to the Voyzu Developer documentation site. 

Please read this documentation carefully, Voyzu is based on a framework of components and patterns designed to enable rapid, accurate development and to maintain a consistancy of the codebase.  Failing to apply the correct pattern or use the correct component will require re-work, even if all the desired functionality is achieved.

I (Chris Lennon), the founder of Voyzu and creator of these patterns, am here to help you :-)  If anything is unclear please reach out to me at chris@voyzu.com

If you find a mistake or something that is missing from this documentation, please head on over to the [github repository](https://github.com/voyzu-docs/dev/) that contains the source code for this site, and raise an issue (or a even a pull request if you are technically inclined)
